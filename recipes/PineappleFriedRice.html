    <h3>Description</h3>

      The dish is believed to have emerged from the vibrant streets of Bangkok,
      where both street vendors and domestic chefs stumbled upon the exquisite
      mix of pineapple and fried rice.
    </p>
    <p>
      The secret to delicious ried rice lies both in the rice and the seasoning
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients Needed</h3>
    <p>
      These are the the ingredients you'll need to make pineapple fried rice:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>1 cup uncooked white rice</li>
      <li>2 cups water</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons sesame/vegetable oil</li>
      <li>3 green onions, thinly sliced including tops</li>
      <li>1 cup diced ham</li>
      <li>½ cup peas</li>
      <li>1 (8 ounce) can pineapple chunks, drained</li>
      <li>1 egg, beaten</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon white suga</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon white pepper</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon garlic powder</li>
      <li>¼ cup soy sauce</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Bring the rice and water to a boil in a saucepan over high heat. Reduce
        heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until the rice is tender, and the
        liquid has been absorbed, 20 to 25 minutes. Spread cooked rice out on a
        rimmed baking sheet and refrigerate until cooled, about 20 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat sesame oil in a large skillet or wok over medium-high heat. Cook
        and stir the green onions, ham, and peas in the hot oil until onions
        have softened, about 2 minutes. Stir the pineapple chunks into the wok;
        cook until pineapple begins to darken, about 2 minute. Push ingredients
        to the side of the wok, and pour beaten egg in the center. Cook until
        egg begins to set, about 30 seconds. Stir together all contents of the
        wok.
      </li>
      <li>
        Mix the cooled rice, sugar, salt, white pepper, and garlic powder into
        the wok; stir constantly to keep from sticking. Cook until heated
        through, about 3 minutes. Sprinkle the rice with the soy sauce, and stir
        to combine.
      </li>
